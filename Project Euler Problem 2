  Even Fibonacci numbers: Each new term in the Fibinacci sequence is
  generated by adding the two previous terms. By starting with 1 and 2,
  the first 10 terms will be:
  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
  exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
